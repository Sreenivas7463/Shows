        disappearances of young girls near the eerie Adavigutta forest.To ease rising panic, village president Prakash
        Rao organizes a vibrant four-day jathara (festival), hoping music, dance, and crowds will drown out the fear.
        Among the attendees are Constable Kanakam, a soft-spoken but brave officer, and Chandrika, a passionate folk
        dancer.But as festivities unfold, strange incidents resurface. A curfew quietly spreads: no girls out after 8
        PM, especially near Adavigutta. Then, without warning, Kanakam and Chandrika vanish from the festival grounds.
        Their sudden disappearance sends shockwaves through Repalle - deepening the mystery of Adavigutta and ending the
        first episode on a chilling note."">
