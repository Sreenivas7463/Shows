            content="After losing his parents in a tragic accident, eight-year-old Vyas finds comfort in Rani Amma, who fills his childhood with magical stories. These stories inspire Vyas to become a teacher, using storytelling to engage his students. He falls in love with Bhagyalakshmi, and they raise their son, Ram. Vyas dreams of opening a school based on his storytelling method, but faces opposition from the school chairman and even Bhagyalakshmi, leaving Ram to bond deeply with his father over stories. His world is further shaken when he's diagnosed with cancer, and he must confront two challenges: telling Ram about his illness and fighting for approval to build his school. Will Vyas overcome these obstacles and change his family's future. ">
