            content="Anitha and Rahul's is an arranged marriage. Despite being married for 2 years, they haven't had children. Rahul views his wife as just a responsibility, not showing love, affection, or surprises.
One day, Anitha finds a love letter Rahul wrote to his ex-girlfriend Meghna during his college days, making her suspect that Rahul still hasn't forgotten Meghna and that's why he's not being
affectionate with her. Anitha befriends Meghna and later arranges for Rahul and Meghna to meet again. When they meet, they reminisce about old times. Meghna proposes to Rahul, saying
they've been reunited by fate and she won't let him go again. Anitha is shocked upon hearing this. The movie's plot revolves around interesting events, such as what happens next, whether
Rahul accepts Meghna's proposal, or if he understands Anitha's feelings and takes her into his arms with love, and what decision Meghna makes.">
