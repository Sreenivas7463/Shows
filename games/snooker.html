        content="Snooker gained its identity in 1875 when army officer Neville Chamberlain, stationed in Ootacamund, Madras, and Jabalpur, devised a set of rules that combined black pool and pyramids. The word snooker was a well-established derogatory term used to describe inexperienced or first-year military personnel. In the early 20th century, snooker was predominantly played in the United Kingdom where it was considered a "
        gentleman's sport" until the early 1960s, before growing in popularity as a national pastime and eventually
        spreading overseas. The standard rules of the game were first established in 1919 when the Billiards Association
        and Control Club was formed. As a professional sport, snooker is now governed by the World Professional
        Billiards and Snooker Association." />
