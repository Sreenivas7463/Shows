            content=""Soothravakyam" unfolds in a serene village in the Palakkad district, centering on Circle Inspector Christo Xavier (Shine Tom Chacko), a dedicated police officer with an unconventional side
hustle: running free mathematics tuition classes for local 11th-grade students at the police station. This unique initiative brings him into a somewhat competitive yet collegial relationship with
Nimisha (Vincy Aloshious), a schoolteacher who finds her own classes losing students to Christo's engaging methods. The narrative takes a darker turn when Arya (Anagha Annet), one of
Christo's students, becomes a victim of brutal domestic abuse at the hands of her elder brother, Vivek (Deepak Parambol). This incident propels the film from its gentle, feel-good beginnings
into a gripping investigation, delving into themes of societal taboos, patriarchy, moral policing, and systemic failures. The film attempts to blend elements of a cop drama, a mystery thriller, and
a social commentary, exploring the quiet intersections of duty, education, and human connection.">
