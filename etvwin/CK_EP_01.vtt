WEBVTT	#Elemental Media Engine(TM) 2.18.0.0

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:21.652
Jyothi, your brother hasn't come yet?

00:01:21.713 --> 00:01:22.940
I'm waiting for him.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.433
He must be late for the bus.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.980
He'll be here soon.

00:01:26.185 --> 00:01:27.532
Ok, I'll wait till your brother comes.

00:01:27.825 --> 00:01:28.640
Ok, uncle.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.418
Hey, stop the engine.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.845
No, uncle.
You go ahead.

00:01:35.933 --> 00:01:37.108
I will go through the shortcut way.

00:01:37.199 --> 00:01:39.328
I might see a villager on the way.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.340
Ok, be careful.

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:41.440
Ok, uncle.

00:01:41.738 --> 00:01:42.593
Right, right.

00:01:43.376 --> 00:01:44.280
Hey, wait.

00:01:44.546 --> 00:01:46.988
Jyothi, don't go towards the Adavigutta forest.

00:01:52.483 --> 00:01:53.383
No, uncle.

00:01:53.454 --> 00:01:54.030
I won't go.

00:01:54.055 --> 00:01:54.535
Ok, dear.

00:01:54.694 --> 00:01:55.530
Right, right.

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:15.249
Hey, Govindu.

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:18.383
Your sister just got down from the bus.
She went into the village through the shortcut way.

00:02:18.434 --> 00:02:18.936
Go fast.

00:02:19.008 --> 00:02:19.491
Okay, uncle.

00:02:19.565 --> 00:02:20.625
The vehicle has broken down.
I'm going.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.830
Right, right.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:09.645
Hey.

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:13.860
Hey, stop.

00:03:14.104 --> 00:03:14.659
Come here.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.760
Where is she?

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.031
I think she escaped.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.046
There she is. Go.

00:03:33.472 --> 00:03:34.565
Hey, Wait.

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:35.852
Hey, Wait.

00:03:37.245 --> 00:03:38.112
Wait.

00:03:39.166 --> 00:03:40.146
Hey, come here.

00:03:44.753 --> 00:03:45.593
Hey, stop.

00:03:45.753 --> 00:03:46.833
She's going away.

00:03:47.068 --> 00:03:48.175
Adavigutta.

00:03:48.753 --> 00:03:49.473
Adavigutta?

00:06:22.186 --> 00:06:23.506
Hey, Why are you like that?

00:06:26.261 --> 00:06:27.368
I have night duty the day after tomorrow.

00:06:27.713 --> 00:06:29.448
The headman gave me night duty near the Adavigutta.

00:06:33.825 --> 00:06:35.353
That's why your face is red.

00:06:36.095 --> 00:06:38.268
Hey, I'm doing typewriting at the station.

00:06:38.425 --> 00:06:39.544
What's the new night duty?

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:40.788
The girl who came was...

00:06:40.882 --> 00:06:41.562
Kanakam.

00:06:41.832 --> 00:06:43.402
Yes, he could have given
the night duty to that girl, right?

00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:45.169
Hey, she's a girl.

00:06:45.253 --> 00:06:45.995
How can he do that?

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:48.096
In a police job, what’s the difference
between a man and a woman?

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.035
She'll get equal salary.

00:06:50.328 --> 00:06:52.788
Anyway, I don't know why our headman likes her so much.

00:06:52.813 --> 00:06:53.533
Shut up.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:56.352
Don't laugh.
I'm getting irritated.

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:58.740
Hey, Muthyalu.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.917
You were born and brought up in this village, right?

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.055
Have you ever filed a theft case?

00:07:03.672 --> 00:07:05.686
Robbery in this village?
What's there to rob?

00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:08.099
Old temple, School in a ruined condition.

00:07:08.486 --> 00:07:09.888
Useless Adavigutta.

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:17.729
I don't know where and how those girls are.

00:07:18.276 --> 00:07:19.913
It feels like some curse has fallen upon this village.

00:07:20.326 --> 00:07:22.276
Everywhere I look,
I see tears and frowns.

00:07:22.542 --> 00:07:23.748
To get rid of that,

00:07:24.035 --> 00:07:27.482
After a gap of three years,
the goddess's festival is being held this year.

00:07:28.016 --> 00:07:31.167
At least now, It would be good
if the Adavigutta curse is broken.

00:07:32.116 --> 00:07:35.334
With all this happening, who would go to Adavigutta?

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:36.127
You go.

00:07:36.603 --> 00:07:37.303
But, you'll never come back.

00:07:38.089 --> 00:07:42.605
Like you, Sathyam, Karuna and Giri come back to this village.

00:07:43.202 --> 00:07:45.162
They didn't get even a single blow on their bodies.

00:07:45.323 --> 00:07:46.382
They died a horrible death.

00:07:49.146 --> 00:07:53.742
Even my cow was sacrificed to that Adavigutta.

00:07:54.223 --> 00:07:55.183
Oh, my God.

00:07:55.305 --> 00:07:58.164
Now, I'm scared to even think about those girls.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.483
Hey, the SI has come.

00:08:00.892 --> 00:08:01.938
Come to meet him.

00:08:02.058 --> 00:08:03.933
Let's talk to the Head and change that duty.

00:08:04.007 --> 00:08:04.487
Let's go.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.300
You said it.
That's a good idea.

00:08:07.083 --> 00:08:09.687
Hey, you'll get it. I'm
telling you. Don't worry.

00:08:09.836 --> 00:08:10.396
Sir, good morning.

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:11.910
Greetings, sir.

00:08:12.729 --> 00:08:14.473
Why do you think we don't have any work?

00:08:15.254 --> 00:08:16.750
Sir, my sister, sir.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.085
We'll tell you if there's any information.

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:20.628
It's been a long time, sir.

00:08:20.728 --> 00:08:22.721
We are facing pressure from our superiors.

00:08:22.856 --> 00:08:24.176
As if that wasn’t enough, you’re the same.

00:08:24.496 --> 00:08:27.136
Sir, I beg you, sir.

00:08:27.663 --> 00:08:28.955
This is not your house.

00:08:29.029 --> 00:08:30.470
You can't stand here all the time.

00:08:31.022 --> 00:08:31.689
Look here.

00:08:32.489 --> 00:08:34.897
I'll inform you as soon as I find out about your sister.

00:08:34.971 --> 00:08:35.791
How many more days, sir?

00:08:35.864 --> 00:08:38.506
Our people have given up sleep
and food to search for your sister.

00:08:39.989 --> 00:08:40.609
Go.

00:08:42.628 --> 00:08:44.698
Don't send anyone to me.

00:08:44.805 --> 00:08:48.282
Sir, I feel a bit sad seeing Govind’s situation.

00:08:48.574 --> 00:08:51.675
If you feel sad, you can't do the police duty.

00:08:52.268 --> 00:08:54.912
If you’re feeling emotional, stay near the house.

00:08:55.529 --> 00:08:57.998
Do as I say in my station.

00:08:59.249 --> 00:09:00.129
Okay, sir.

00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:01.609
Sir.

00:09:03.224 --> 00:09:05.717
Why did you come now?
Yours is the afternoon shift, right?

00:09:05.841 --> 00:09:08.628
You like mutton rice, right? That’s why I got it.

00:09:08.789 --> 00:09:10.765
Then, why did you stop there?

00:09:10.823 --> 00:09:11.343
Come.

00:09:11.642 --> 00:09:12.222
Sir.

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:13.530
What?

00:09:13.735 --> 00:09:15.642
Today is the festival of Polamma Thalli.

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:19.158
I want to know who will be sent to security.

00:09:19.322 --> 00:09:20.794
Do you want to ask me for this?

00:09:21.909 --> 00:09:24.280
That's why, even with age, you’re
still stuck like a head constable.

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:28.180
you just sitting idle.

00:09:28.677 --> 00:09:32.091
Ravi, Hari, Rajashekar.
Send them.

00:09:36.565 --> 00:09:38.852
By the way, what is the name of the lady constable?

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:39.930
Kanakamahalakshmi.

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:40.870
Yes, Kanakamahalakshmi.

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:41.410
Which shift?

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:42.750
I will tell you after seeing.

00:09:43.089 --> 00:09:43.949
General shift.

00:09:44.342 --> 00:09:45.544
8 o'clock duty, sir.

00:10:06.959 --> 00:10:07.999
It's time for duty.

00:10:08.099 --> 00:10:09.071
Go.

00:10:39.502 --> 00:10:40.895
You look beautiful, Schandrika?

00:10:41.347 --> 00:10:42.601
So beautiful.

00:10:42.872 --> 00:10:43.869
Thanks, aunty.

00:10:48.953 --> 00:10:49.439
Kanakam

00:10:49.473 --> 00:10:50.003
Kanakam

00:10:50.037 --> 00:10:50.550
Kanakam

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:51.077
Kanakam

00:10:51.144 --> 00:10:51.631
What happened?

00:10:51.665 --> 00:10:52.132
Open the door.

00:10:52.238 --> 00:10:52.835
Kanakam

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:53.942
Let's go from behind.

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:56.770
Kanakam

00:10:57.112 --> 00:10:57.992
Kanakam

00:10:58.638 --> 00:10:59.445
Kanakam

00:11:00.235 --> 00:11:01.202
Kanakam

00:11:01.575 --> 00:11:02.525
Where are you?

00:11:02.955 --> 00:11:03.828
Kanakam

00:11:04.137 --> 00:11:05.574
Where can't she be seen?

00:11:05.986 --> 00:11:07.143
Kana...

00:11:10.354 --> 00:11:11.301
What happened?

00:11:17.922 --> 00:11:18.935
What is this?

00:11:20.699 --> 00:11:21.491
Shoo!

00:11:22.826 --> 00:11:24.205
Move! Move!

00:11:24.949 --> 00:11:28.691
Why are you so scared?  It’s just a lizard.

00:11:29.512 --> 00:11:32.878
How can you do police duty if you're so scared?

00:11:33.262 --> 00:11:34.475
She can do it, aunty.

00:11:35.048 --> 00:11:36.541
I don't know what to do

00:11:36.983 --> 00:11:38.169
She is brave girl, aunty

00:11:38.455 --> 00:11:39.875
But She gets a little scared.

00:11:40.048 --> 00:11:41.001
I will take care

00:11:41.527 --> 00:11:43.289
You won't let your friend say a word, right?

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:44.905
How many more days?

00:11:45.116 --> 00:11:48.877
The festival will end on the day you're with her.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.820
After that you have to get ready and go

00:11:51.908 --> 00:11:53.828
I have to take care of her, right?

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:55.208
It's ok, aunty

00:11:55.415 --> 00:11:57.914
I will tell my father and get her transferred to our village.

00:11:58.154 --> 00:11:58.748
Oh

00:11:58.965 --> 00:12:00.185
God!

00:12:00.429 --> 00:12:05.331
Don’t do that. If Kanakam is not with me,
I’ll feel bad.

00:12:05.438 --> 00:12:06.664
That is the problem, aunty.

00:12:07.047 --> 00:12:08.229
We can't live without each other

00:12:08.442 --> 00:12:09.669
When I think about it,

00:12:09.755 --> 00:12:12.855
I don't know how we became so close
in such a short span of time.

00:12:13.401 --> 00:12:15.660
Will she do anything to me?

00:12:15.966 --> 00:12:19.023
I am also doubting you, Sindhrika

00:12:19.143 --> 00:12:20.363
Will you both stop now?

00:12:20.465 --> 00:12:22.197
I am getting late for my duty

00:12:22.278 --> 00:12:24.078
I will go and prepare the carriage.

00:12:24.924 --> 00:12:25.991
You stay here.

00:12:26.197 --> 00:12:28.196
She comes in the middle of the bath,
thinking the lizard will come again.

00:12:28.383 --> 00:12:30.225
I amam getting late.

00:12:30.333 --> 00:12:31.413
I am going.

00:12:47.433 --> 00:12:49.517
Kanakam, Kanakam, Kanakam, Kanakam,

00:12:50.807 --> 00:12:51.378
I am getting late

00:12:51.432 --> 00:12:52.338
You forgot the carriage.

00:13:30.207 --> 00:13:31.207
Wait, I am also coming.

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:32.515
I am getting late for my duty.

00:13:32.689 --> 00:13:33.781
I will meet you at the fair in the evening.

00:13:33.935 --> 00:13:35.255
Ok, come at the time of the game.

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:36.336
Ok, ok

00:13:46.955 --> 00:13:50.358
I welcome all the participants
of Palaamma Thali festival.

00:13:50.757 --> 00:13:57.617
I wish the participants to celebrate
this festival and get blessings.

00:13:58.023 --> 00:14:02.663
Our President has also given from the Goddess us
good medical treatment

00:14:02.932 --> 00:14:07.085
Our villager Hanumanth rao, is distributing free medicines.

00:14:07.459 --> 00:14:09.431
All of you should come and take the medicines.

00:14:09.806 --> 00:14:14.280
Our President will come
anytime and give the first order.

00:14:14.513 --> 00:14:16.640
All of you should be patient.

00:14:16.828 --> 00:14:18.888
We should celebrate the festival successfully.

00:14:24.423 --> 00:14:25.383
Oh no!

00:14:25.422 --> 00:14:26.651
I am late today also.

00:14:26.884 --> 00:14:28.082
I don't know what SI sir will say.

00:14:32.529 --> 00:14:33.529
Sorry sir, I am late.

00:14:33.622 --> 00:14:34.820
Aunty has sent the box to both of you.

00:14:35.062 --> 00:14:37.260
Why did you come so late?

00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:39.435
SI sir is inside.

00:14:40.248 --> 00:14:41.123
It is good.

00:14:41.659 --> 00:14:42.870
You performed really well.

00:14:43.325 --> 00:14:46.229
So, you just show up and make
the entry whenever you feel like it?

00:14:47.122 --> 00:14:48.302
What else do you want?

00:14:48.536 --> 00:14:49.776
Whether I’m here or not,
it’s all the same.

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:51.665
Is there anything still in your way?

00:14:52.816 --> 00:14:53.836
Sir...

00:14:54.062 --> 00:14:54.855
No, no, no.

00:14:55.568 --> 00:14:57.101
I am not saying anything to you.

00:14:57.269 --> 00:14:59.509
You don't have to trouble yourself.

00:14:59.653 --> 00:15:01.010
Come whenever you want.

00:15:01.457 --> 00:15:02.930
Go whenever you want.

00:15:03.402 --> 00:15:06.487
If you want, you can keep the log book with you.

00:15:07.063 --> 00:15:08.123
Sorry sir.

00:15:13.326 --> 00:15:14.546
What sorry?

00:15:15.287 --> 00:15:17.979
People who don't have time
maintenance are not fit for police duty.

00:15:20.759 --> 00:15:22.059
Not only you.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:26.188
You used the ladies' quota as a way to come here.

00:15:26.706 --> 00:15:27.752
My seniors.

00:15:28.532 --> 00:15:29.758
They must be told off.

00:15:33.136 --> 00:15:34.260
We are men.

00:15:35.148 --> 00:15:39.069
If we are in trouble here,
she will come and solve it.

00:15:44.193 --> 00:15:47.548
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:15:48.134 --> 00:15:49.721
Did I say anything wrong?

00:15:50.819 --> 00:15:51.799
Tell me.

00:15:52.533 --> 00:15:54.333
You are right sir.

00:15:54.566 --> 00:15:57.164
You should not wear pant, shirt like a man.

00:15:57.399 --> 00:15:58.654
You should work like a man.

00:15:58.867 --> 00:15:59.920
It is not that easy.

00:16:01.775 --> 00:16:03.060
I came late for duty.

00:16:03.407 --> 00:16:05.361
How can you stand like this?

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:07.160
First day of the fair.

00:16:07.842 --> 00:16:08.820
First day of the festival.

00:16:09.082 --> 00:16:10.322
Many women will come.

00:16:10.792 --> 00:16:11.953
Go to the festival security right now.

00:16:12.199 --> 00:16:13.039
Yes sir.

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:20.890
Take care of your work.

00:16:31.765 --> 00:16:32.400
Oh.

00:16:35.671 --> 00:16:37.304
Listen to me.

00:16:37.496 --> 00:16:39.736
Our president is coming.

00:17:28.059 --> 00:17:29.390
Kind-hearted person.

00:17:29.613 --> 00:17:30.510
Like that.

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:31.720
Merciful man.

00:17:31.806 --> 00:17:32.410
What?

00:17:32.762 --> 00:17:35.120
He is a good man who works
for the welfare of our village.

00:17:35.456 --> 00:17:37.034
The God of all of us.

00:17:37.296 --> 00:17:38.036
Who?

00:17:38.399 --> 00:17:40.005
Our village president.

00:17:49.916 --> 00:17:54.370
Our village president will inaugurate the festival.

00:17:54.644 --> 00:17:55.170
What?

00:17:55.747 --> 00:17:57.307
All the devotees.

00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:59.067
Receive the blessings of God.

00:17:59.236 --> 00:18:01.307
All of you will receive the blessings of the Goddess.

00:18:17.906 --> 00:18:19.166
In all of your faces.

00:18:19.902 --> 00:18:21.569
There is more fear than devotion.

00:18:21.635 --> 00:18:22.443
That is why.

00:18:22.489 --> 00:18:24.570
All the rituals and customs are put aside.

00:18:25.003 --> 00:18:26.521
For your well being.

00:18:27.396 --> 00:18:29.295
I am doing the festival of Goddess.

00:18:29.896 --> 00:18:31.926
If you take good care of Goddess in these 5 days.

00:18:32.179 --> 00:18:33.845
Goddess will also take good care of you.

00:18:37.097 --> 00:18:38.552
No matter how many problems you face.

00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:42.038
There should be no problems during the Goddess's festival.

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:14.366
Move forward.

00:19:14.445 --> 00:19:15.466
Move forward.

00:19:15.491 --> 00:19:16.726
Stand properly.

00:19:17.412 --> 00:19:18.791
Stand properly.

00:19:20.373 --> 00:19:21.173
Walk fast.

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:22.988
Walk fast.

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:33.360
Goddess.

00:19:33.613 --> 00:19:34.958
Calm down. Calm down.

00:19:35.013 --> 00:19:36.276
Goddess bless us.

00:19:36.402 --> 00:19:38.216
Save the village from the Adavigutta.

00:19:38.347 --> 00:19:39.327
It is your duty.

00:19:39.433 --> 00:19:40.640
Calm down. Calm down.

00:19:50.855 --> 00:19:51.660
Hey.

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:53.460
Son-in-law.

00:19:53.502 --> 00:19:55.068
Maybe you didn’t come,
we were upset about everything.

00:19:55.122 --> 00:19:56.095
Why should you get scared?

00:19:57.013 --> 00:19:58.193
Without me.

00:19:58.853 --> 00:20:00.160
How could you celebrate the festival without me?

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:01.440
What is this?

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:02.527
This?

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:03.200
It is a kite.

00:20:03.599 --> 00:20:04.760
I did see it on the way.

00:20:05.133 --> 00:20:06.013
I brought it.

00:20:06.367 --> 00:20:07.267
It is okay.

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:08.900
Here.

00:20:10.382 --> 00:20:11.904
Look at the arrangements.

00:20:12.253 --> 00:20:13.329
This is not enough.

00:20:13.467 --> 00:20:14.000
Is it?

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:16.345
It is not enough.
I will take care of it.

00:20:16.432 --> 00:20:17.200
Enough.

00:20:17.438 --> 00:20:18.800
We should celebrate the festival with success.

00:20:18.977 --> 00:20:19.820
Offer the incense.

00:20:19.924 --> 00:20:20.580
Remove that.

00:20:20.797 --> 00:20:21.440
Okay.

00:20:21.699 --> 00:20:22.467
Uncle

00:20:22.554 --> 00:20:24.193
Tie it properly.

00:20:28.906 --> 00:20:29.566
That one.

00:20:29.591 --> 00:20:30.400
This one?

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:31.131
That colour.

00:20:31.156 --> 00:20:31.726
Take that.

00:20:35.293 --> 00:20:36.073
This is okay.

00:20:36.157 --> 00:20:37.440
What is this? Ganga.

00:20:37.486 --> 00:20:38.682
When did you come from the hostel?

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:41.060
I came yesterday.

00:20:41.085 --> 00:20:41.981
For the festival.

00:20:42.966 --> 00:20:45.837
** Singing **

00:20:46.872 --> 00:20:48.098
What is this? uncle.

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:50.440
I will take care of the festival.

00:20:50.519 --> 00:20:51.406
Nothing.

00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:53.247
It seems that the girls are not
coming out alone at night time.

00:20:53.766 --> 00:20:55.526
If you go out alone.

00:20:55.866 --> 00:20:56.946
Call me.

00:20:57.421 --> 00:20:58.792
I will come and take you.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:20:59.739
Did you understand?

00:20:59.879 --> 00:21:01.200
No need. I will go with my mother.

00:21:01.484 --> 00:21:02.480
I will come back.

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:04.240
Why are you saying like this?

00:21:06.791 --> 00:21:08.231
[Singing]

00:21:15.409 --> 00:21:16.430
Come fast.

00:21:16.669 --> 00:21:17.441
Walk.

00:21:17.522 --> 00:21:18.110
Walk.

00:21:18.217 --> 00:21:19.157
Go fast.

00:21:24.986 --> 00:21:26.189
I have no control the pig.

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:29.336
You can't even control a piglet,
how will you control your wife?

00:21:29.456 --> 00:21:30.308
You are a girl.

00:21:30.392 --> 00:21:32.369
You’re misbehaving with the girls at the fair.

00:21:32.672 --> 00:21:34.302
Should I take you to the police station?

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:36.360
What did I do?

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:37.820
Don't act.

00:21:37.993 --> 00:21:39.333
You flashed your watch light on the girl.

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:41.285
Did you think that I did not see?

00:21:41.515 --> 00:21:43.720
She is my sister-in-law Ganga.

00:21:43.879 --> 00:21:45.219
She is not replying when I call her.

00:21:45.833 --> 00:21:47.134
That's why I flashed the light on her.

00:21:47.399 --> 00:21:48.891
Do you know how much trouble she is in?

00:21:48.991 --> 00:21:49.780
Have you thought about it?

00:21:49.875 --> 00:21:50.700
What is this?

00:21:50.806 --> 00:21:52.443
You have been talking nonsense for a while now.

00:21:52.807 --> 00:21:54.251
What if I flashed the light on you?

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.288
If you stay here for some more time,

00:21:56.503 --> 00:21:58.018
I'll have to flash you too.

00:21:59.097 --> 00:22:00.133
You said it very well.

00:22:02.521 --> 00:22:03.021
Hey!

00:22:07.261 --> 00:22:08.147
Madam, you go.

00:22:08.172 --> 00:22:09.250
I'll take care of him.

00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:09.745
My Piglet!

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:10.129
Hey

00:22:10.195 --> 00:22:10.695
Ouch!

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:11.371
Ouch!

00:22:11.396 --> 00:22:11.876
Hey!

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:19.800
Hey!

00:23:19.853 --> 00:23:20.968
How dare you hit?

00:23:21.281 --> 00:23:22.148
I didn't hit him.

00:23:22.209 --> 00:23:23.085
Didn't he play not to touch?

00:23:23.111 --> 00:23:24.116
If he touch, Why did you hit him?

00:23:24.245 --> 00:23:25.405
He's acting crazy.

00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:26.518
Why can't I keep quiet?

00:23:26.543 --> 00:23:27.288
Why is he acting crazy?

00:23:27.349 --> 00:23:28.320
What do you think of yourself?

00:23:28.345 --> 00:23:29.280
Hey, Suribabu! Stop!

00:23:47.245 --> 00:23:47.741
Mr. President!

00:23:47.766 --> 00:23:49.214
This girl hit our team leader.

00:23:49.616 --> 00:23:50.076
Why?

00:23:50.993 --> 00:23:51.733
Why did you hit him?

00:23:51.992 --> 00:23:53.130
He touched me.

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:54.410
Did he touch you on purpose?

00:23:54.536 --> 00:23:55.506
Will you disappear if he touches you?

00:23:55.531 --> 00:23:56.031
Shut up!

00:23:56.403 --> 00:23:57.270
Don't talk nonsense.

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:01.828
Don't you know how to talk to a woman?

00:24:02.145 --> 00:24:02.969
That's not true.

00:24:03.035 --> 00:24:05.556
If people know that she hit our team leader,
won't we lose our reputation?

00:24:06.117 --> 00:24:07.377
Why are you talking like that?

00:24:07.473 --> 00:24:08.090
Shut up!

00:24:08.318 --> 00:24:09.357
I'm talking to her.

00:24:09.546 --> 00:24:11.136
Stop this nonsense and start playing.

00:24:11.437 --> 00:24:12.167
That's what I'm saying.

00:24:12.191 --> 00:24:12.770
Hey!

00:24:14.248 --> 00:24:15.150
Start playing.

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:37.400
Sit down.

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:46.426
What are you both doing here?

00:24:47.142 --> 00:24:48.396
What happened was...

00:24:49.172 --> 00:24:50.052
Nothing.

00:24:50.078 --> 00:24:51.425
We wanted to visit the temple to see the deity.

00:24:51.511 --> 00:24:52.007
But there was a long queue.

00:24:52.094 --> 00:24:52.934
That's why we sat here.

00:24:53.625 --> 00:24:55.140
The queue won't reduce if we sit here.

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:56.092
Come.

00:24:56.298 --> 00:24:57.316
Let's go for a darshan.

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:03.085
Tell me the name of your clan.

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:04.060
Paidipala Gotram.

00:25:04.236 --> 00:25:05.065
Dhanushurasi .

00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:05.966
Bhaarani nakshatram

00:25:12.806 --> 00:25:13.966
Take it.

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.120
Take it.

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:20.578
Did you get the collection?

00:25:20.633 --> 00:25:21.439
Yes.

00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:23.758
Hello!

00:25:23.871 --> 00:25:25.351
Mic testing 1, 2, 3.

00:25:25.655 --> 00:25:26.812
People who came for the festival,

00:25:27.033 --> 00:25:28.851
people from our village,
people from other villages,

00:25:29.095 --> 00:25:31.061
young and old, listen carefully.

00:25:31.142 --> 00:25:35.922
Before 8 o'clock at night, all the
women should go to the forest.

00:25:36.375 --> 00:25:39.316
Especially, no one should go to the Agavigutta (forest).

00:25:41.738 --> 00:25:43.455
This is the SI's order.

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:48.310
Chandrika.

00:25:48.405 --> 00:25:49.090
Let's go.

00:25:49.785 --> 00:25:50.510
Madam.

00:25:50.611 --> 00:25:52.646
We’ll come together after we finish the duty.

00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:54.230
Is it?

00:25:55.261 --> 00:25:56.181
Okay.

00:25:59.353 --> 00:26:00.453
What happened?

00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:02.090
Madam.

00:26:02.229 --> 00:26:03.455
Why are there so many pins?

00:26:03.742 --> 00:26:04.873
Let's go.
I'll buy you new slippers.

00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:06.090
No need now.

00:26:08.644 --> 00:26:09.644
Don't delay.

00:26:09.745 --> 00:26:10.610
Come soon.

00:26:14.282 --> 00:26:15.142
Tell me.

00:26:15.167 --> 00:26:16.050
What's the plan?

00:26:16.075 --> 00:26:17.030
Wait for a while.

00:26:17.055 --> 00:26:18.132
I'll tell you after the duty.
