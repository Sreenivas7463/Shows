            content="Krishna, a civil engineer from Hyderabad, believes in one strange principle – never help anyone. He is sent to Bhairi Lanka village to construct bathrooms, but the villagers refuse him entry simply because he’s an outsider. The village has one peculiar rule: no outsider can talk to and see Raja, the only girl in the village because every man there wants to marry her. Krishna is permitted to stay only if he agrees to avoid her completely. Everything goes smoothly until villagers learn about the relationship between Krishna and Raja. Do they know each other already? Why is Raja the only woman in the village? What’s behind the village’s strange customs? Why all the men in the village want to marry Raja? The rest of the film unravels these mysteries. ">
